__About_Me__
##

[![image1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shawesome4u/Shawesomes_Divine_Armaments/main/15.png)](https://ko-fi.com/shawesome)

I'm just a fledgling modster so please be patient for new items and such. I'm a new parent also so free time for me is truly a commodity! I have been allocating any spare time, when not being the __BEST__ Dad and Hubby ever, to learn the process of modding valheim because cheatmode is not OP enough for me. I dare to tread the mythical realm of the Modding Gods!

If you enjoy the mod and would like to see more content please consider, if you feel so inclined, buying me a snack on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/shawesome) to help me on my quest, Nom Nom Nom!

##

**(Stats & Recipies have been updated but will more than likley see more tweaks in the future)** ~~~~ and add a lot of other equipables such as shields, weapons, armor, potions/consumables and creatures!(Yes, more capes too!) -

There is a bunch of cleaning up to do (selecting the correct shaders for a few particles/prefabs that will clear up the yellow warnings) Please be patient with the fixes/updates :D thank you! If there is something that is interfering with your other mods and you find this mod to be the source PLEASE reach out!!!!! 

I Hope you have as much fun using the mod as we are having making it! <3

I also decided to add the item_ID so yall can spawn stuff in (I also like to use the VNEI mod for quicker spawning and seeing what the recipies are) 

I don't plan to add configs any time soon so if you think a recipe/attack dmg/attack cost/ effect etc etc should be something else, please let me know i love talking about ideas! Your help may even inspire a new item in your honor! :D
